A repository with scripts to decrypt.

# USE WITH RESPONSIBILITY.

---
To use test this library, enter a hash in the `permutation` script, and wait.
It will decrypt it, but patience is needed.

<br>
Keep a few points in mind:

* It is still in development. 
* No dependencies.
* Tested on PyPy3 and Cpython.
* Quite time consuming.
* Any hash can be cracked, if algorithm is same.

**The developer is NOT responsible** for misuse of this program for unethical use  by any user  . This is intended for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**.
