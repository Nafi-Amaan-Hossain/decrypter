# passcracker
---
A repository with scripts to crack any password. 
<br>
# [!!] USE WITH RESPONSIBILITY.

---
To use test this library, enter a password in the `permutation` script, and wait.
It will crack it, but patience is needed.

<br>
Keep a few points in mind:

* It is still in development. 
* No dependencies.
* Runs on Python3. Smooth on PyPy3 also.
* Quite time consuming in PyPy3 also.
* Any password can be cracked.
